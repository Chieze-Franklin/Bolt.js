## Bolt.js

Bolt.js is a Node.js-based app runtime environment written in JavaScript.

With Bolt.js you get to run your JavaScript web apps and websites in an environment rich with all the necessary support your app may need.

## Getting Started

* Bolt is built on Node.js, so ensure you have Node (and npm) installed.
* On your terminal/console/command prompt, navigate to this directory.
* Run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies.
* Ensure the path */sys/data/mongodb* exists.
* Configure Bolt as required in *sys/server/config.json*.
* Determine what should happen during setup in *sys/server/setup.json*.
* Run <code>npm start</code> or <code>node bolt</code>.
* On your browser, navigate to <code>{{config-host}}:{{config-port}}</code> to start working in the Bolt environment.
