## Bolt.js

Bolt.js is a Node.js-based app runtime environment written in JavaScript.

With Bolt.js you get to run your JavaScript web apps and websites in an environment rich with all the necessary support your app may need.

## Getting Started

* Clone or pull the project to your repository.
* Run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies.
* Download the appropriate MongoDB files into the appropriate folder in */sys/bins/mongodb*.
* Ensure the path */sys/data/mongodb* exists.
* Configure Bolt as required in *node_modules/bolt-internal-config/lib/config.json*.
* Determine what should happen during setup in *node_modules/bolt-internal-setup/lib/setup.json*.
* Run <code>npm start</code> or <code>node bolt</code>.
